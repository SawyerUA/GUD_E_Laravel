# GUD-E - Board Strategy

GUD-E should be a board game when everything will be ready.

It should be a real boardgame like: Arkhem, Manchkin, Rokugan or something similar to.  
I think that a half of work, maybe a big part of it is done, for example: created map, rules, thoughtful design etc.

But for now, I just created a welcome web-site (a pet-project) for my own practice.  
I sincerely believe that if all goes well, our author team will transfer this game into the digital form.
